questions to ask the prof about:
- what does concurrent access mean? as in two client and concurrenlty read/write the same file? or that two client can only concurrently access different files
- depending on the previous question, what semantics should we adapt? is there a restriction on that?
- remote access vs download/upload
- how much local cache do we want?
- what happens when a client attempts to write a file that is currently being access?
